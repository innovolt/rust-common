# rust-common
While coding in RUST, I found few things which are repeatedly used and tedious to implement when they are compared with other languages like Python, C++ etc. For example, vector is much needed data structure when it comes to implement searching, sorting etc. algorithm over array. So, it will be beneficial if we can move the logic to take vector input to common place. With the time, I'll be adding more utility functions.

If anybody is interested to add utility function that you think is of your use and can be used by others as well so feel free to add them in the repository.



Note: I am open to feedback regarding anything, whether it's about structuring the repository or anything else. So, kindly provide your feedback.
